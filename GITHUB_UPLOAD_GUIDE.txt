🚀 GITHUB UPLOAD GUIDE - Netflix Clone
========================================

QUICK STEPS (Already Done by Script):
✓ Git repository initialized

NOW YOU NEED TO DO:
===================

STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository
---------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: netflix-clone
3. Description: Full-stack Netflix clone with React, Node.js, MongoDB
4. Keep it PUBLIC (for free deployment)
5. DON'T initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

STEP 2: Copy Your Repository URL
---------------------------------
After creating, you'll see a URL like:
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/netflix-clone.git

Copy this URL!

STEP 3: Push to GitHub
---------------------------------
Run these commands (replace YOUR-USERNAME):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/netflix-clone.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Enter your GitHub username and password when prompted.
(Use Personal Access Token instead of password)

STEP 4: Verify Upload

Refresh your GitHub repository page.
You should see all your files uploaded!

WHAT'S NEXT:

After GitHub upload is complete, you can:
1. Deploy backend to Render (connects to GitHub)
